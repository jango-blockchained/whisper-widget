# GTK Migration Tasks

## Steps for Migration

1. **Identify GTK 3.0 Usage:**
   - Search the codebase for any instances where GTK 3.0 is explicitly required or used.
   - Check for any deprecated functions or widgets that were used in GTK 3.0.

2. **Update Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that all dependencies and libraries used in the project are compatible with GTK 4.0.
   - Update any third-party libraries that might still be using GTK 3.0.

3. **Modify Code for GTK 4.0:**
   - Replace deprecated GTK 3.0 functions with their GTK 4.0 counterparts.
   - Update the code to use new GTK 4.0 features and APIs.

4. **Test the Application:**
   - Thoroughly test the application to ensure that all functionalities work as expected with GTK 4.0.
   - Pay special attention to UI components, as GTK 4.0 may have different rendering behaviors.

5. **Update Documentation:**
   - Update any documentation to reflect changes made during the migration.
   - Ensure that installation instructions include GTK 4.0 dependencies.

## Considerations

- **Backward Compatibility:**
  - Determine if backward compatibility with GTK 3.0 is necessary. If so, consider using conditional imports or version checks.

- **UI Changes:**
  - GTK 4.0 introduces new ways to handle UI components, so be prepared to refactor parts of the UI code.

- **Performance Improvements:**
  - Take advantage of performance improvements in GTK 4.0, such as better rendering and resource management.

- **Community and Support:**
  - Leverage community resources and documentation for guidance on specific migration challenges.
